# Community-F-15EX-Eagle-II
The F-15EX Eagle II is the USAF's latest version of the F-15E Strike Eagle.  Equipped with the latest weapons, sensors, and pilot interface technology, the F-15EX is arguably the most advanced 4th generation fighter in existence today.  As a military aviation enthusiast, my goal is to bring the F-15EX to life in DCS; World.
Since I am relatively new to modding DCS, I'd like to thank everyone who has contributed to the overall success of this project thus far.  Special thanks to Currenthill, Geschirre, Emerald467, ]KNNZubr, and the VSN Team.  Without their help, this mod would not have been possible.
